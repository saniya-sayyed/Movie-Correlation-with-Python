# Movie-Correlation-with-Python
In this project, we look at what variables effect the gross revenue from movies. 

Python libraries used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

We first read and clean the data using pandas and then plot visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn to understand the correlation between different variables.
