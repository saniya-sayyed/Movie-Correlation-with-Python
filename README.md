# Movie-Correlation-with-Python
In this project, we look at what variables effect the gross revenue from movies. 

Python libraries used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

We first read and clean the data to handle Missing Values, Duplicates and perform Data Formatting and Transformation using Pandas and Numpy.
We then plot Data Visualizations with the use of matplotlib and seaborn and understand the Correlation between different variables.
